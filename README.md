# Research on Modern Slavery 

This repository is going to contain a collection of experiments and analyses performed on the Modern Slavery Statements Dataset.


## Context
The UN Sustainable Development Goal 8.7 states:
Take immediate and effective measures to eradicate forced labour, end modern slavery and human trafficking and secure the prohibition and elimination of the worst forms of child labour, including recruitment and use of child soldiers, and by 2025 end child labour in all its forms. [add link]

In 2018, the Global Slavery Index found that there were 40.3 M people in modern slavery, of whom 25M were in forced labor producing computers, clothing, agricultural products, raw materials, etc and 15M were in forced marriage. [add link]

By sharing your analysis and contributing to this repository you help the global community to hold multi-national corporations accountable for how they treat their workforce and suppliers.


## How to access the data?

The data is available in the `modern-slavery-dataset-txt` bucket in AWS S3. The future plans involve releasing the dataset to the public as part of the AWS Open Data program [add link]. 

As it's work in progress, at present, if you'd like to work with this data, please send an email to edgar@bravetech.io with your name and a link to some social profile (linkedin, github, facebook, VK or similar ) and you'll receive IAM user credentials on the first possible instance that would allow you to download and access the data.
